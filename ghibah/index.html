                        <p><strong>Gheebah</strong> (غِيْبَة) means <strong>backbiting</strong>: speaking about a Muslim in their absence in a way they would dislike, whether it is true or false—about their body, lineage, character, deeds, or anything else. The Prophet ﷺ defined it clearly:</p>
                        <blockquote class="gheebah-quote">
                            "Do you know what backbiting is?" They said, "Allah and His Messenger know best." He said, "It is to mention about your brother that which he would dislike." Someone asked, "What if what I say about my brother is true?" He said, "If what you say about him is true, you have backbitten him; and if it is not true, you have slandered him."
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="source"><strong>Source:</strong> <cite>Sahih Muslim 2589</cite></p>

                        <h3>Why Is It So Terrible? It Is Like Zina of the Tongue</h3>
                        <p>Islam treats backbiting as one of the <strong>gravest sins</strong>. Allah likens it to <strong>eating the flesh of your dead brother</strong>—something that would fill any person with disgust. The Prophet ﷺ also warned that backbiting can destroy a person's good deeds and bring the same kind of spiritual ruin as major sins:</p>
                        <blockquote class="gheebah-quote">
                            "The one who backbites and the one who listens to it are partners in sin."
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="source"><strong>Source:</strong> <cite>Musnad Ahmad, Sunan Abi Dawud</cite> — and the listener is commanded to reject it.</p>
                        <p>Scholars have described backbiting as "<strong>zina of the tongue</strong>" because, like zina, it violates the sanctity of another person, spreads harm, and is strictly forbidden. The Prophet ﷺ said that backbiting is <strong>worse than adultery</strong> in the sense that Allah may forgive the latter when the person repents, but the one who was backbitten must forgive the backbiter before the sin is lifted—making it a sin that can follow a person until the Day of Judgment if the victim does not forgive.</p>

                        <h3>Punishment in the Quran</h3>
                        <p>Allah says in <strong>Surah Al-Hujurat (49:12)</strong>:</p>
                        <blockquote class="gheebah-quote arabic-block">
                            يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اجْتَنِبُوا كَثِيرًا مِّنَ الظَّنِّ إِنَّ بَعْضَ الظَّنِّ إِثْمٌ ۖ وَلَا تَجَسَّسُوا وَلَا يَغْتَب بَّعْضُكُم بَعْضًا ۚ أَيُحِبُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَن يَأْكُلَ لَحْمَ أَخِيهِ مَيْتًا فَكَرِهْتُمُوهُ ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ تَوَّابٌ رَّحِيمٌ
                        </blockquote>
                        <p><em>"O you who have believed, avoid much [negative] assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin. And do not spy or backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother when dead? You would detest it. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is Accepting of repentance and Merciful."</em></p>

                        <h3>Punishment and Warnings in the Hadith</h3>
                        <p>The Prophet ﷺ described the <strong>harsh consequences</strong> of backbiting in this life and the next:</p>
                        <ul class="gheebah-list">
                            <li><strong>Scavengers of the grave:</strong> It was reported that the Prophet ﷺ passed by two graves and said the occupants were being punished—one for backbiting and one for not cleaning himself from urine. He said the backbiter would have flesh torn from him in the grave. <cite>Source: Sahih al-Bukhari 1378, Sahih Muslim 292</cite></li>
                            <li><strong>Partners in sin:</strong> "Whoever backbites a Muslim has wronged him; so whoever is able to compensate him, let him do so. Otherwise, the one who was backbitten will take from the backbiter's good deeds on the Day of Resurrection." <cite>Source: Musnad Ahmad, authenticated by scholars</cite></li>
                            <li><strong>Defending honor:</strong> "Whoever defends his brother's honor in his absence, Allah will shield his face from the Fire on the Day of Resurrection." <cite>Source: Sunan al-Tirmidhi 1931, Jami` at-Tirmidhi</cite></li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="gheebah-block">
                        <h3>Stories of Punishment and Repentance</h3>
                        <p>In the hadith of the <strong>two women in the grave</strong>, the Prophet ﷺ explained that they were being punished—one for backbiting and the other for not guarding herself from urine. The one who backbit was made to tear at her own flesh. This shows the severity of the sin in the sight of Allah.</p>
                        <p>Another narration teaches that on the Day of Resurrection, the <strong>good deeds of the backbiter are transferred to the one who was backbitten</strong>. If the backbiter runs out of good deeds, the sins of the victim are placed upon the backbiter. This is among the harshest spiritual punishments described in the Sunnah.</p>

                        <h3>Conclusion: Guard Your Tongue</h3>
                        <p>Gheebah is not a small mistake—it is a <strong>major sin</strong> that Allah and His Messenger ﷺ have condemned in the strongest terms. It destroys brotherhood, spreads hatred, and leads to severe punishment in the grave and on the Day of Judgment. We must guard our tongues, avoid backbiting, and if we have wronged someone with our speech, seek their forgiveness and repent to Allah.</p>
